# NodeBox – Visual Automation Builder

**NodeBox** is a visual automation platform inspired by [n8n], built for people who want to automate *anything* with the power of Python.

## How NodeBox Works

At its core, **NodeBox** lets you design workflows on a **canvas-like interface**, where you can:

- **Drag, drop, and connect nodes**
- Each **node is just Python code**:  
   it can receive inputs, process them, and return outputs
- Combine nodes to build **simple scripts → advanced multi-step automations**

> **Unlike traditional automation tools that lock you into pre-defined actions, NodeBox gives you the full flexibility of Python — limited only by your creativity.**

## Key Idea  

*If you can write Python, you can automate it with NodeBox.*

## AI Integration with Ollama  

One of the **standout features** of NodeBox is its **deep integration with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)**.  
Since much of modern automation relies on AI, NodeBox allows you to:

- **Browse** Ollama models  
- **Download & manage** models locally  
- **Integrate LLMs** directly into your workflows  

This means you can build **AI-powered automations** without pricey API keys.  
Everything runs **locally, offline, and under your control**.

## What You Can Do with NodeBox  

- Automate repetitive tasks  
- Build **custom AI-driven workflows**  
- Connect & process data from multiple sources  
- Stay private with **local execution**

## Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up the application from source:

### 1. Prerequisites

Before installing, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.10+ [click here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Ollama [click here](https://ollama.com/)
- PyQt6 (`pip install PyQt6`)

### 2. Clone repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shreyansh-shankar/NodeBox.git
cd NodeBox
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**Activate it:**
- Linux/Mac:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

- Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 5. Setup Ollama

- Install Ollama following the official [guide](https://ollama.com/)
- Run the command in terminal to check installation: `ollama --version`.
- Run the command: `ollama serve`. If it starts a server or returns something like `ollama is already runniing`, you are good to go.

### 6. Run the application
```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Create Your First Automation

Follow these steps to build your very first automation inside the app:
```plaintext
- Open the Application – Start the app from your system.
- Browse Models – Head over to the Browse Models section.
- Pick a small model (recommended for first-time setup).
- Click Download.
- Verify Download – Go to View Local Models to ensure the model is installed.
- Create a New Automation – Click New Automation and give it a name.
- Open Automation Editor – Select your automation and click Edit.
- Add a Node – Right-click on the canvas and choose Add Node.
- Edit the Node – Click on the node and click on the open button.
- This will open the Node Editor, where you can write custom Python code.
- Run and test the node to ensure it works as expected.
- Build More Nodes – Add additional nodes (e.g., input, processing, output).
- Connect Nodes – Drag from one node's output port to another's input port to link them.
- Run the Automation – Once connected, click Run to test the complete workflow.
- Debug & Iterate – If something breaks, check node logs and update code accordingly.
- Save Your Work – Don't forget to save your automation for later use.
```
Tip: Start small (like a text-to-text pipeline) before experimenting with complex multi-node automations.

## Example Use Cases
- Run a local LLM to summarize documents
- Watch a folder and auto-organize files
- Scrape data from websites and process it
- Send notifications when system events occur
- Chain together AI models + traditional scripts
