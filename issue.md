### Issue: Request CI Setup with GitHub Actions

**Description:**

To improve code quality, streamline contributions, and ensure the project remains stable as it grows, it would be highly beneficial to set up Continuous Integration (CI) using GitHub Actions.

**Why CI is needed for NodeBox:**

1.  **Automated Code Quality Checks:** CI can automatically run linters (like `pylint` or `flake8`) on every pull request. This helps maintain a consistent code style and catches potential syntax or logic errors early, before they are merged into the main branch.
2.  **Automated Testing:** As features are added and the codebase expands, having a suite of automated tests (unit, integration) that run via CI is crucial. It ensures that new changes do not inadvertently break existing functionality, increasing confidence in the code's reliability.
3.  **Build Verification:** CI can automatically attempt to build the application (e.g., using `pyinstaller`) for different platforms. This would quickly identify issues that prevent the application from being packaged and distributed.
4.  **Easier Contribution Process:** For contributors, especially during events like Hacktoberfest, a clear CI status (passing/failing) on their pull requests provides immediate feedback. This makes it easier for maintainers to review and merge contributions, and for contributors to know if their changes meet the project's standards.
5.  **Increased Confidence & Stability:** Overall, having CI in place increases confidence in the codebase's stability and reduces the manual effort required by maintainers to verify each contribution.

Implementing CI with GitHub Actions would be a valuable step forward for the NodeBox project.
